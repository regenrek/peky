description: "Creates comprehensive handoff documents for seamless AI agent session transfers. Triggered when: (1) user requests handoff/memory/context save, (2) context window approaches capacity, (3) major task milestone completed, (4) work session ending, (5) user says 'save state', 'create handoff', 'I need to pause', 'context is getting full', (6) resuming work with 'load handoff', 'resume from', 'continue where we left off'. Proactively suggests handoffs after substantial work (multiple file edits, complex debugging, architecture decisions). Solves long-running agent context exhaustion by enabling fresh agents to continue with zero ambiguity."

# peky-session-handoff

Creates comprehensive handoff documents that enable fresh AI agents to seamlessly continue work with zero ambiguity. Solves the long-running agent context exhaustion problem.

## Mode Selection

Determine which mode applies:

**Creating a handoff?** User wants to save current state, pause work, or context is getting full.
- Follow: CREATE Workflow below

**Resuming from a handoff?** User wants to continue previous work, load context, or mentions an existing handoff.
- Follow: RESUME Workflow below

**Proactive suggestion?** After substantial work (5+ file edits, complex debugging, major decisions), suggest:
> "We've made significant progress. Consider creating a handoff document to preserve this context for future sessions. Say 'create handoff' when ready."

## CREATE Workflow

### Step 1: Create the Handoff File (manual)

No scripts are shipped with this skill. Create the handoff file manually:

1) Pick a handoff directory:
   - Prefer tool-native folders if they exist: `.codex/handoffs/`, `.claude/handoffs/`, `.cursor/handoffs/`
   - Otherwise use `.handoffs/` at the project root
2) Create a timestamped file name:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (example: `2026-01-28-auth-part-2.md`)
3) If this continues previous work, add a “Continues from” line at the top.

### Step 2: Complete the Handoff Document

Open the generated file and fill in all `[TODO: ...]` sections. Prioritize these sections:

1. **Current State Summary** - What's happening right now
2. **Important Context** - Critical info the next agent MUST know
3. **Immediate Next Steps** - Clear, actionable first steps
4. **Decisions Made** - Choices with rationale (not just outcomes)

Use this template structure:

```
# Handoff: <short title>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Project: <repo or path>
Branch: <branch>
Continues from: <file or N/A>

## Current State Summary
- [TODO: concise summary]

## Important Context
- [TODO: critical decisions, constraints, assumptions]

## Changes Made
- [TODO: key files/areas touched]

## Immediate Next Steps
1. [TODO: concrete next action]
2. [TODO: follow-up]

## Open Questions / Risks
- [TODO: unresolved items or risks]
```

### Step 3: Validate the Handoff (manual)

Manually validate:
- [ ] No `[TODO: ...]` placeholders remain
- [ ] Required sections present and populated
- [ ] No secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- [ ] Referenced files exist
- [ ] Next steps are concrete and testable

### Step 4: Confirm Handoff

Report to user:
- Handoff file location
- Validation score and any warnings
- Summary of captured context
- First action item for next session

## RESUME Workflow

### Step 1: Find Available Handoffs

List handoff files in the project’s handoff directory:
`ls .codex/handoffs .claude/handoffs .cursor/handoffs .handoffs 2>/dev/null`

### Step 2: Check Staleness (manual)

Review:
- Time since handoff
- Commits since handoff
- Files changed since handoff
- Missing referenced files

If changes are significant, treat the handoff as stale and verify before acting.

### Step 3: Load the Handoff

Read the relevant handoff document completely before taking any action.

If handoff is part of a chain (has "Continues from" link), also read the linked previous handoff for full context.

### Step 4: Verify Context

Follow the checklist in [references/resume-checklist.md](references/resume-checklist.md):

1. Verify project directory and git branch match
2. Check if blockers have been resolved
3. Validate assumptions still hold
4. Review modified files for conflicts
5. Check environment state

### Step 5: Begin Work

Start with "Immediate Next Steps" item #1 from the handoff document.

Reference these sections as you work:
- "Critical Files" for important locations
- "Key Patterns Discovered" for conventions to follow
- "Potential Gotchas" to avoid known issues

### Step 6: Update or Chain Handoffs

As you work:
- Mark completed items in "Pending Work"
- Add new discoveries to relevant sections
- For long sessions: create a new handoff with `--continues-from` to chain them

## Handoff Chaining

For long-running projects, chain handoffs together to maintain context lineage:

```
handoff-1.md (initial work)
    ↓
handoff-2.md --continues-from handoff-1.md
    ↓
handoff-3.md --continues-from handoff-2.md
```

Each handoff in the chain:
- Links to its predecessor
- Can mark older handoffs as superseded
- Provides context breadcrumbs for new agents

When resuming from a chain, read the most recent handoff first, then reference predecessors as needed.

## Storage Location

Handoffs are stored in: `.claude/handoffs/`

Naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[slug].md`

Example: `2024-01-15-143022-implementing-auth.md`
