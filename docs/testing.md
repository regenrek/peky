# Testing

Run unit tests with coverage:

```bash
go test ./... -coverprofile /tmp/peakypanes.cover
go tool cover -func /tmp/peakypanes.cover | tail -n 1
```

Race tests:

```bash
go test ./... -race
```

Manual npm smoke run (fresh HOME/XDG config):

```bash
scripts/fresh-run
scripts/fresh-run X.Y.Z --with-project
```

GitHub Actions runs gofmt checks, go vet, go test with coverage, and race on Linux.
