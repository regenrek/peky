# Stream Quick Reply to Terminal (Plan)

Goal: optional mode. When quick reply focused, typing feels like typing into selected pane. Quick reply still shows input, but the same keystrokes are sent to the pane.

Config (gated)
- `quick_reply.stream_to_pane: true|false` (default false)

Safety rules (non-negotiable)
- Never stream when input is a slash command (`/…` after trimming leading whitespace).
- Never stream when terminal focus is on.
- Never stream when pane is offline/dead/input-disabled/unselected.
- Never block UI on send failures; best-effort only.
- Avoid “wrong pane”: if selection changes, drop any buffered bytes (V1).

## V1 (ship)

Scope
- Stream safe subset only:
  - text runes + space
  - tab
  - backspace + delete (only when quick reply has content)
  - left/right/home/end (best-effort; mirrors keypresses, not terminal state)
  - enter: flush buffered bytes, then send `\r`, then clear quick reply input + record history
- Disable quick reply menus while streaming:
  - slash suggestions (`/`)
  - `@` file picker
  - up/down history navigation + menu selection UI

Implementation outline
1) Config plumbing
   - Add `QuickReplyConfig.StreamToPane` in `internal/layout/config.go`.
   - Document config in `docs/configuration.md`.

2) Model state
   - Add stream buffer + debounce state to the TUI model:
     - buffer bytes
     - target pane id
     - generation token to cancel scheduled flushes
     - last toast time (rate limit)

3) Buffered sender (performance)
   - Append bytes per eligible key.
   - Flush on short timer (~15ms) to batch into a single `SendInput`.
   - Flush immediately on enter.
   - Cap buffer size; on overflow flush early.

4) Pane switch handling
   - On any selection change:
     - increment generation token (cancels pending flush)
     - drop buffer
     - (optional) single toast “stream dropped: pane changed” (rate limited)

5) Tests
   - Streaming batches multiple keystrokes into ≤1 RPC within a flush window.
   - Slash command start (`/`) never streams.
   - Enter streams newline and clears quick reply without double-send.
   - Pane switch cancels pending flush and drops buffered bytes.
   - Offline/dead panes do not stream and do not spam toasts.

## V2 (more complex; defer)

Terminal-driven line mirroring (up/down history, prompt edits, multiline)
- Requires a real terminal line model (PTY/readback) to keep quick reply input in sync with what the shell is showing.
- Without this, history keys change the terminal line but the quick reply input can't reflect it, which is confusing.

Menu mirroring (keep menus while streaming)
- If menu completion changes quick reply text, terminal must receive the corresponding edit delta.
- Requires the same terminal line model as terminal-driven mirroring.

Smarter pane switch policy
- Option: flush buffered bytes to old pane on key-driven selection changes only, drop on mouse changes.
- Needs deterministic ordering + more integration tests.
